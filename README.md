# Unboxing Engineering
This repository hosts the code for Unboxing Engineering, an interactive educational website designed to help high school students explore the various disciplines within the field of engineering. The website provides an immersive, hands-on learning experience where users can discover how different types of engineers contribute to the development of everyday objects, such as an iPhone.

Through an interactive 3D model of an iPhone, users can explore 19 components and learn how various engineering fields like electrical, mechanical, software, and more come together to create a technological product.

## About the Project
Unboxing Engineering aims to address the need for engaging and educational resources for students to learn about the interdisciplinary nature of engineering. By breaking down a familiar device like the iPhone, the website highlights the contributions of different engineering fields, providing a comprehensive understanding of how technology is created.

## Features
- Interactive 3D Model: Deconstructed iPhone model with clickable components.
- Educational Content: Detailed explanations of the engineering disciplines involved in the creation of each component.
- User-Friendly Design: UI/UX design crafted for easy navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Blender: For creating 3D animations of the iPhone disassembly.
- Figma: For UI/UX design.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building the structure, style, and interactivity of the website.
- Three.js: For rendering the 3D iPhone model in the browser.
- HTMX: For dynamic icon management.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our supervisor Prof. Belinda Wang, our administrator John Taglione and our course instructor Prof. Bruno Korst. This project was completed as part of the ECE496 Capstone Design Project course during our final year. Their guidance, support, and expertise were invaluable throughout the development of this project.
